# Project definition
A device that works with TTGO v1 storing the information it receives from various sensors, and sending the data via LoRa to a raspberry server that has nodered. 

# Procedure
To make easier the process of making this project, we have divided it in different parts. 

## Materials
To carry out this project we have used the following materials:

### Sensors:

· KY-026 fire sensor

· GY-BMEP280 temperature/humidity/pressure sensor

· Flying Fish gas sensor

### Modules:

· ESP32 Lilygo TTGO

· ESP32 TTGO

### Computer used to see the information

· Raspberry Pi 4

### Software used for programming

· Arduino IDE

## Connections

## Steps
1-First of all we must make the connections found in the attached "Schematic" file above. For the program to work it must detect the BMEP280 sensor.

2-The second thing to do is to load the "LoRaSender" program in our TTGO with the connections already made.
